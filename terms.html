    <h1>Terms of Service for Hershey ðŸŽ·</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 11, 2025

    <p>Welcome to Hershey ðŸŽ· ("the Bot"), operated by LFuse. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Bot on the Discord platform. By adding or using the Bot, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Bot.</p>

    <p class="disclaimer"><strong>IMPORTANT LEGAL DISCLAIMER:</strong> This is a template provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. You should consult with a qualified legal professional to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and platform requirements (Discord, Spotify, etc.).</p>

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Hershey ðŸŽ· is a Discord bot designed to connect to your Spotify account (with your explicit permission via Spotify's OAuth flow) to access, store, and display your Spotify listening history and statistics. Features include viewing top songs/artists/genres, tracking currently playing songs, processing uploaded extended listening history, and optionally generating AI commentary on your listening habits or comparing tastes between users.</p>

    <h2>2. User Accounts and Spotify Connection</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To use features related to your Spotify data, you must explicitly authorize the Bot to access your Spotify account using the <code>/connect</code> command and Spotify's secure OAuth2 authorization process.</li>
        <li>By authorizing the connection, you grant the Bot permission to access the data specified during the authorization flow (including listening history, top tracks/artists, user profile information) as outlined in our Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Discord and Spotify accounts.</li>
        <li>You can revoke the Bot's access to your Spotify account at any time through your Spotify account settings page (usually found under "Apps" or "Security" on the Spotify website). Revoking access will prevent the Bot from fetching new data but may not automatically delete previously stored data (see Privacy Policy Section 6 for deletion requests).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use the Bot:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
        <li>In any way that violates Discord's Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.</li>
        <li>In any way that violates Spotify's Terms and Conditions of Use or Developer Policy.</li>
        <li>To harass, abuse, or harm other users.</li>
        <li>To attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Bot's systems or another user's data.</li>
        <li>To interfere with or disrupt the Bot's operation or the servers hosting it.</li>
        <li>To upload malicious files or data via the <code>/upload</code> command or any other means.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Accuracy and Availability</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Bot relies on data provided by the Spotify API and data uploaded by users. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the data presented. Discrepancies may exist between stored history and real-time Spotify data. Genre information is derived from Spotify API data related to artists and may not reflect precise listening time per genre.</li>
        <li>The Bot's availability is not guaranteed. We may need to perform maintenance or encounter technical issues that result in downtime.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. AI Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The <code>/roast</code> and <code>/compare</code> commands utilize the Google Generative AI (Gemini) API to provide commentary. This commentary is generated by AI based on anonymized track/artist lists and is intended for entertainment purposes only.</li>
        <li>AI-generated content may sometimes be inaccurate, nonsensical, or unexpected. We are not responsible for the specific content generated by the third-party AI service. Use these features at your own discretion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Bot, including its code, design, and features (excluding user-provided data and third-party APIs/logos like Discord, Spotify, and Google), is the property of LFuse and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. Spotify, Discord, and Google logos and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.</p>

    <h2>7. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>THE BOT IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.</li>
        <li>LFuse DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</li>
        <li>IN NO EVENT SHALL LFuse BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE BOT.</li>
        <li>OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE BOT IS LIMITED TO <strong>[USD $0.00 - OR CONSULT LAWYER FOR A NOMINAL AMOUNT LIKE $1.00. This needs legal review based on risk assessment.]</strong>.</li> <!-- FILL IN / ADJUST AFTER LEGAL REVIEW -->
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the Bot at any time, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of <strong>[Your State/Country, e.g., California, USA or Ontario, Canada - MUST CONSULT LAWYER]</strong>, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p> <!-- FILL IN AFTER LEGAL REVIEW -->

    <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of changes by updating the "Last Updated" date on the document hosted at <strong>[Link to this document on GitHub Pages]</strong> and may announce significant changes within the support Discord server. Your continued use of the Bot after any changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p> <!-- FILL IN URL ONCE HOSTED -->
